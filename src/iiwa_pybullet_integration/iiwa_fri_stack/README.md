# iiwa FRI Stack
Collection of packages to run the KUKA iiwa robot arms using the fast robot interface in ROS.

## Installation (quick version)
  1. Clone the repository into your catkin workspace
  2. Copy the contents of the iiwa_fri_java package into the src folder of your sunrise project (this will copy the RoboticsAPI.data.xml file so if you have changed the default one you will need to merge it with your file).
  3. Install the fast robot interface in the sunrise project, configure the KONI ip address and synchronise with the robot controller
  4. Build the catkin workspace
